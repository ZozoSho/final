            More Info ▸
            Named after a black hole and a song, this is a porter like no other. We took an old English porter recipe, added some rye malt, and our porter was born. This brew floods your palate with hints of chocolate, biscuit and all-around roasty goodness with just a touch of smoke that finishes dry but is not overpowering. Perfect with roasts or fowl. Enjoy by the fire, and it will certainly warm you on any cold evening in the Great White North.

                Serving Sizes: 16oz Draft</p>

            More Info ▸
            Finally, a Surly beer my German mother will drink. She says this one tastes like a bier from back home. Not unlike a Zwickel Bier from Germany, Hell is our filtered and fermented with lager yeast, American hops takes a back seat to the Pils malt sweetness and fresh bread aroma. The color is well... hell (Deutsch for light). It’s fiendishly drinkable, and you don’t have to sell your soul to get another.

            Castle Cream Ale was created while sitting around the kitchen table during our start-up days, and the need for a sessionable beer became clear. Castle Cream is our version of a Cream Ale. Deep gold in color, it has a soft malty aroma, slightly sweet creamy texture with a balanced bitterness, while finishing smooth and clean.

           <h2> Bourbon Barrel Quad Belgian Quad</h2>

            <p>11.2% ABV  26 IBU  Boulevard Brewing Co.  Kansas City, MO
            More Info ▸
            Based loosely on the Smokestack Series’ The Sixth Glass, this abbey-style quadrupel is separated into a number of oak bourbon barrels where it ages for varying lengths of time, some for up to three years. Cherries are added to make up for the “angel's share” of beer lost during barrel aging. Selected barrels are then blended for optimum flavor. The resulting beer retains only very subtle cherry characteristics, with toffee and vanilla notes coming to the fore.

                Serving Sizes: 10oz Draft</p>

            <p>5% ABV  36 IBU  Cigar City Brewing  Tampa, FL
            More Info ▸
            The people of Tampa Bay have fallen prey to Pirate invasion every year for well over 100 years. After more than a century of failing to repel these seafaring raiders in their anachronistic wooden ships, despite access to modern sea, land and air arsenals that ostensibly should make short work of wind powered vessels equipped with naught but cast iron cannons and raging scurvy, it occurred to the folks of Cigar City Brewing that if you can’t beat them start saying Arrrr Matey! And so we have brewed Invasion Pale Ale, a citrusy and tropical session beer brewed for those long days of marauding, pillaging and pirating. Cheers!

            More Info ▸
            Lift Bridge’s Warden Milk Stout clocks in at 5.75% ABV and pours a deep black with a thin, whitish-tan head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of coffee with hints of smoke greet the nose, and the beer’s flavors include a complementary combination of sweet and savory in the forms of chocolate and roasted malt. At 23 IBU, there’s a trace of earthy hop bitterness on the backend. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and the unfermentable sugar from the lactose leaves the sweetness on the palate that you’d expect from a milk stout.
